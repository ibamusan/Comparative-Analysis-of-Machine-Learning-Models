Title: Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models for Energy Demand Forecasting in the UK: A Case Study of England
In the contemporary world, energy assumes a pivotal role, propelling not only economies but also the aspirations of societies. With populations experiencing rapid expansion and economies undergoing swift growth, the demand for energy resources is on the rise. This scenario underscores the imperative of precise energy demand prediction, driving the necessity for an enhanced approach to energy supply management amid unparalleled challenges. Machine Learning (ML) methods have been acknowledged as the superior approach compared to traditional methods for achieving accurate prediction outcomes. These methods have been applied across various studies focusing on energy consumption in both residential and industrial settings. Nevertheless, limited research explores the suitability of ML techniques for national-level energy consumption forecasting. To bridge this gap, this study investigates the performance of five machine learning models—linear regression (LR), support vector regression (SVR), regression tree (RT), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting (GB)—for energy demand forecasting. Historical energy consumption data from the UK, with a focused lens on England, are employed to meticulously assess the accuracy and reliability of each model. The findings highlight RF as the most effective model, followed by LR, GB, SVR, and RT. Furthermore, the analysis delves into constraints and challenges, encompassing feature importance, data incompleteness, and non-linear relationships. The study advocates for further research to encompass additional variables influencing energy demand and explore alternative machine learning techniques adept at capturing non-linear correlations. By shedding light on the most suitable machine learning model for energy demand forecasting, this work contributes to enhancing energy management, planning, and decision-making processes.
